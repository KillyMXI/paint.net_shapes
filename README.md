# What is this

Collection of custom shapes for raster graphics editor [Paint.NET](http://getpaint.net/) and some tools to assist in custom shape creation process.

If all you need is just a shapes archive, go [grab it there](http://mxii.eu.org/project/paintdotnetstuff). In case I'll do plugins or anything else for Paint.NET in future - it also could be tracked there.

[How to make custom shapes](http://forums.getpaint.net/index.php?/topic/32101-h)

## Convert-Shape.ps1

PowerShell script to automate Xaml file conversion when making custom shapes for Paint.NET.

Look into Convert-Shape.ps1 for details on how to use it. There is also a bat file as a live sample of usage.

## Custom shapes

Source files, editable with [Kaxaml](http://www.kaxaml.com/) or Visual Studio are located in "pages_" folders.

Ready to use Paint.NET custom shape files are stored in "mxi_shapes_" folders for convenience.

### mxi_shapes_photo

Some shapes to assist in photo editing. There are some common grids, mostly related to Golden Ratio.

### mxi_shapes_rulers_and_measurements

Some shapes to mark dimensions on images.

### mxi_shapes_misc_grids

Some grids. Maybe someone will find some of them usefull too.

For many applications raster graphics editor is NOT the right tool, so this set is kind of experimental.

### mxi_shapes_superellipse

[Superellipse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superellipse) shapes.

* factor 3 is here just to fill the gap between other values.
